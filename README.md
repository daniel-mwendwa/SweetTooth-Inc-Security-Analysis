# SweetTooth-Inc-Security-Analysis
  
## Overview  
This repository contains a comprehensive security analysis conducted on a simulated environment. The exercise focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in an InfluxDB server, exploiting misconfigurations, and enhancing cybersecurity skills through ethical hacking practices. 

## Key Objectives 
- Perform reconnaissance on the target system using tools like `nmap`.
- Exploit authentication mechanisms by generating and using JWT tokens.
- Analyze database configurations and retrieve sensitive data. 
- Exploit vulnerabilities to gain system access, including creating reverse shells.
- Conduct privilege escalation to access root files and escape Docker environments. 

## Tools & Techniques
- **Nmap**: For network scanning and service detection.
- **JWT Tokens**: For authentication and authorization exploitation.
- **Burp Suite & cURL**: For interacting with web services and APIs. 
- **Netcat**: For reverse shell creation and interaction.
- **Linux Commands**: For privilege escalation and database queries.

## Key Learnings
Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in:
1. Identifying and exploiting insecure configurations.
2. Using advanced querying techniques to retrieve sensitive information. 
3. Understanding vulnerabilities in web applications, databases, and containers.
4. Applying mitigation strategies to address the identified weaknesses.
